# 📖 Digital Shackles: The Story of One Study
### Storytelling analysis of the project *"Students' Social Media Addiction"*

---

## 🌍 Global Context
Today, social networks are not just communication tools — they are digital ecosystems competing for every second of our attention.  
We analyzed data from **700+ students across six continents** to understand: where does entertainment end and addiction begin?

---

## 1️⃣ The Dopamine Trap of Algorithms
Our study revealed a clear boundary between types of platforms:

- 💬 **Messengers** (WhatsApp, Telegram) → used as tools.  
- 📸 **Algorithmic feeds** (TikTok, Instagram) → used like a drug.  

> Students who choose TikTok and Instagram as their primary platforms show **18% higher addiction levels**.  
> The endless feed creates an illusion of novelty, forcing the brain to release dopamine, which leads to loss of control over time.

---

## 2️⃣ The Price of "Free" Content
We found that for every extra hour spent online, students pay with their most valuable resource — **health**.

- 😴 **Sleep**: Each hour beyond the norm reduces sleep by **42 minutes**.  
- 🧠 **Mental state**: Students with high levels of addiction show **38% lower psychological well-being scores**.

---

## 3️⃣ The Social Paradox
Although networks are called "social," they often become a source of conflict.

- ⚠️ The most vulnerable group — students with the status *"Complicated"*.  
  For them, social networks become a battlefield and a source of jealousy, leading to the highest frequency of conflicts in real life.  

- 💞 In contrast, stable relationships (*"In Relationship"*) act as a **protective buffer**, reducing the level of digital addiction.

---

## 4️⃣ The Mathematics of Behavior (ML Insight)
Using machine learning (**K-Means**), we were able to "see" invisible groups:

- 🟢 **Balanced**: Use networks purposefully, sleep 7–8 hours, maintain stable mental health.  
- 🟡 **At-Risk**: Spend more than 4 hours online, sleep begins to shorten.  
- 🔴 **Addicted**: More than 6 hours online. For this group, social networks have replaced real hobbies and quality rest.

---

## 🏁 Final Conclusion
**Digital addiction is not a myth, but a new reality.**  
The project proved that the greatest danger lies not in the technologies themselves, but in the algorithms of consumption.

> The main lesson of the study:  
> It is important not to be a product of the algorithm, but a conscious user of the tool.  
> Balance between "online" and "offline" is not a luxury, but a necessary condition for preserving mental health in **2026**.
